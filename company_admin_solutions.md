For a small import/export firm with three employees, finding a suitable administrative software solution is crucial for managing tasks such as inventory, sales, customer relations, and finances efficiently. I'll compare several Content Management Systems (CMS) that could be appropriate, including Odoo, which is known for its versatility and scalability. The focus will be on affordability, ease of use, features relevant to import/export businesses, and scalability. 

Here's a comparison table of different CMS options:

### Note:
The links provided direct you to specific sections of each software's official website, where you can find more detailed and updated information about their features, pricing, and other relevant aspects. Keep in mind that external factors like hosting costs, the need for technical support, and additional plugins or extensions can affect the overall cost and usability of these platforms.

### Analysis:

1. **Odoo**: Great for firms looking for a comprehensive solution that can scale as the business grows. The community edition is free, but more advanced features require a subscription. It's a bit more complex to set up and use.

2. **WordPress with WooCommerce**: A cost-effective option if you're already familiar with WordPress. It's highly customizable with numerous plugins, but advanced features may require paid add-ons.

3. **Shopify**: Ideal for those seeking ease of use with a user-friendly interface. It's slightly more expensive but includes robust sales and inventory features. The monthly subscription includes hosting, which simplifies setup.

4. **Magento**: A powerful option for those with technical expertise. It offers extensive customization and scalability, but the cost of hosting and add-ons can be significant.

### Recommendation:

For a small team without extensive technical expertise and seeking a balance between functionality and cost, **WordPress with WooCommerce** could be a good starting point. It's user-friendly, customizable, and has a vast community for support. If the business anticipates rapid growth and requires more comprehensive features, **Odoo**'s paid versions or **Magento** could be considered, keeping in mind the additional costs and technical requirements.
